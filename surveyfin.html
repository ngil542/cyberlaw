	<h2>Current Cyberstalking Laws in Washington state:
		RCW 9.61.260
		Key Issues:</h2>
        <p>Penalties are not hard enough. Current Cyberstalking penalties are a gross misdemeanor unless "the perpetrator has previously been convicted of the crime of harassment as defined in RCW 9A.46.060, with the same victim or a member of the victim's family or household." It is very difficult to prove and catch the criminals at large because criminals are more likely to attack multiple platforms, for example: not just eaves-dropping on a PC, but also their cell phone, other home devices that utilize bluetooth, and/or IoT. To report this crime just once involves proof and knowing how to deal with it. It is not only harassment but something that can lead to extreme privacy violations when theft is really the target. It is not simply harassment it is stealing access to credit, credit cards, reputation, and even job or loss of life. It more than likely leads to identity theft or fraud. Crime rings are formed and combine efforts to stalk and steal. More simply stated, this form of stalking is dangerous and crosses over many legal boundaries. It is a danger to our economy, and a danger to society, which will eventually tear our country apart. To think that just one person is out there stalking or stealing, and capable of multiplatform stalking is impossible to find and convict. Internet Service Providers and cell phone distribution centers are a primary target and would be the most likely source to look into. One cannot even trust that their router is connected to a trusted source or even the cellular phone connected to a service one paid for. Stalking of any kind in today's climate crosses over all boundaries. With this in mind, please consider supporting updating and revising this law to include a more serious conviction for the first time offender. Imposing longer sentences and fines to keep these offenders out of the general public and to think about the consequences.
