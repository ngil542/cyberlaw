	<h2>Current Cyberstalking Laws in Washington state:
		RCW 9.61.260
		Key Issues:</h2>
        <p>Today’s cyberstalking penalties are not hard enough.   Currently, the penalties for cyberstalking is a gross misdemeanor unless "the perpetrator has previously been convicted of the crime of harassment as defined in RCW 9A.46.060, with the same victim or a member of the victim's family or household." It is very difficult to prove and catch the criminals at large because these criminals are more likely to attack multiple platforms, for example: not just eaves-dropping on a PC, but also a cell phone or other home devices that utilize wifi, bluetooth, and/or IoT. To report this crime just once involves proof and knowing how to deal with it.  When this crime repeats itself or escalates, the victim may face not only problems with upset in one’s life but also damage beyond that takes years to recover.  Cyberstalking is harassment, it is a violation of one’s privacy, personal information, reputation, finances, and can escalate to loss of life.  A cyberstalker may be involved in a crime ring, triangulating your location, tapping your phone, swapping phones, knowing where you live, and at this point is stalking on a dangerous level.  This makes finding one criminal more difficult when in fact there are many.  A crime ring is a gang.  In the future, it may cost us much more because this gang is growing, changing, and gaining on us.  We need to stop this by charging those who cyberstalk with a tougher penalty.  We might look into what it will take to secure the boundaries between communications and criminals.  One step further is to consider those who are internet service providers, cell phone distributors, and IT professionals, that they are securing our communication freedoms and privacy.  Communications is a responsibility.  In order to protect and preserve respect, dignity, freedom, and privacy, we need to impose greater fines, longer sentences, and tougher penalties.
